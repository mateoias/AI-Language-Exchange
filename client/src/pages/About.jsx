            <p>
              Welcome to the computer assisted language learning website. My name is <strong>Matthew Werth</strong> 
              and I have been a language teacher for many years. Currently I am working on 
              a number of automated tools to make life easier for language teachers and language learners.
            </p>
            <p>
              This tool is an automated language exchange chatbot for students who want to practice their 
              language skills, it is divided into three levels with fine tuned prompts to make language 
              learning easier. The guiding philosophy is <strong>CI with TPRS</strong>, especially at the lower levels.

                  you can internalize grammatical structures.

            <h2>About the Language Exchange Chatbot</h2>
            <p>
              The chatbot is powered by <a href="https://openai.com/api/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="external-link">OpenAI</a>, 
              this is a wrapper for the GPT 4.0 model that has been optimized for conversation 
              based on the level that you choose.

            <div className="info-box">
              <h3>Important Notes</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>The model responses are usually factually accurate, but there is no guarantee and that isn't important for language learning</li>
                <li>GPT hallucinates sometimes, so if the conversation gets too weird, just change the topic and carry on</li>
                <li>You, the human, are ultimately responsible for what happens in these conversations, chatGPT is generally
                eager to please, so it's easy to get it to say weird and/or unsavory things, but that's usually because
                the computer thinks that what you wanted based on your side of the text.</li>
